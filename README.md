## Intro

This project was done for the lesson of Technologies of Internet Applications at the Department of Informatics and Telecommunications at the University of Athens in Greece. The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack website that emulates the behavior of the popular website of Booking including the frontend and backend applications, the database behind it and an effective recommendations system.

## Parts

The app consists of the following parts:
* **Frontend:** Was created using React.js and includes a login system that interacts with the backend in order to ensure protection, an effective search page of properties, a property page that allows only registered users to book, complete booking system and finally a management system for the manager of the page that makes available different statistics and enables user adding and deletion
* **Backend:** Was created using Spring Boot and includes complete interaction with the database, encrypted verification of info of the clients, actions throught the website and complete control of the data by the managing entity
* **Database:** Was created using MySQL and is a complete database with intact relational logic and complete entity management
* **Recommendations System:** In Java that, although not using machine learning methods, is highly effected when tested on a sample of rooms.

***Note:*** Additional Info can be found on the *readme.pdf* file in the database_README folder.
